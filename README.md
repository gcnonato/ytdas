## Authentication

The <a href="Passport">Passport</a> module is used for Google Oauth 2.0 authentication.  You will need to edit the config.json file with your client ID and client secret to complete authentication.

## Getting Started

Edit the config.json file with your needed information - pay specific attention to the client.owner parameter.  This is the channel that you will be authenticating as.  In my experience it has been your channel name in all lowercase with <strong>'-'</strong> replacing spaces.  You can add your own logos and header image as well.
